    - The object will contain properties for everything you want to store in the state.

				- Notice that we use className instead of class. 
				  This is our first hint that the code being written here is JavaScript, 
				  and not actually HTML.
        - It is JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML.
          With JSX, we can write what looks like HTML,
          and also we can create and use our own XML-like tags. 
        - Using JSX is not mandatory for writing React. 
        - Under the hood, it's running createElement, which takes the tag, 
          object containing the properties, and children of the component 
          and renders the same information.
        - Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase - onclick will become onClick.
        - Self-closing tags must end in a slash - e.g. <img />
        - JavaScript expressions can also be embedded inside JSX using curly braces, 
          including variables, functions, and properties.
