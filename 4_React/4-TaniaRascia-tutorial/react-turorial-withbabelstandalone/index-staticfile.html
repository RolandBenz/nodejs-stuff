            - It is JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML.
              With JSX, we can write what looks like HTML,

            - Using JSX is not mandatory for writing React. 
            - Under the hood, it's running createElement, which takes the tag, 
              object containing the properties, and children of the component 
              and renders the same information.
            - Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase - onclick will become onClick.
            - Self-closing tags must end in a slash - e.g. <img />
            - JavaScript expressions can also be embedded inside JSX using curly braces, 
              including variables, functions, and properties.

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
